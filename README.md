# Fair Dummies: Achieving Equalized Odds by Resampling Sensitive Attributes

This package implements "Fair Dummies": a flexible framework [1] for learning predictive models that approximately satisfy the equalized odds notion of fairness. This is achieved by introducing a general discrepancy function that rigorously quantifies violations of this criterion, formulating a differentiable penalty that drives the model parameters towards equalized odds.

To rigorously evaluate fitted models, we also implement a formal hypothesis test to detect when a prediction rule violates the equalized odds property. Both the model fitting and hypothesis testing leverage a resampled version of the sensitive attribute obeying the equalized odds property by construction.

Lastly, we demonstrate how to incorporate techniques for equitable uncertainty quantification---unbiased for each protected group---to precisely communicate the results of the data analysis.

## Getting Started

The implementation of [1] is self-contained and written in python.

## Usage

Please refer to [synthetic_experiment.ipynb](synthetic_experiment.ipynb) for basic usage. The notebooks [real_classification_experiment.ipynb](real_classification_experiment.ipynb) and [real_regression_experiment.ipynb](real_regression_experiment.ipynb) demonstrate how to use the software package on real data.

Comparisons to competitive methods and additional usage examples of this package can be found in [all_classification_experiments.py](all_classification_experiments.py) and [all_regression_experiments.py](all_regression_experiments.py).
